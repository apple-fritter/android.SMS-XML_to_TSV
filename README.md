# androidmessages.tsv
A simple rust program to export messages from an android device to nested TSV files.

Here's an example of what one of the resulting TSV files might look like:
```
THEM    08  23  04      Hello, how are you?
ME      08  24  31      I'm good, thanks. How about you?
THEM    08  25  17      Doing well, thanks.
```
